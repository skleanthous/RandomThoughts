# Software project and Newtonian Physics  
I enjoy finding analogies between different context.  
I enjoy comparing software project to something else than 'Building a house'

[So I tweeted this :](https://twitter.com/ylorph/status/540505860548481025)
>Ec =0,5 mv^2
>The biggest your team, legacy, scope & velocity.  
>if you're heading for a wall , it's gonna hurt  


Kinetic energy is equal to half of mass multiplied by the square of the speed  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy

This is also the amount of energy that you have to spend to halt some mass.  
Now , imagine if the halt is sudden, hitting a wall.  
The more mass or velocity the more energy released,  
the more potential damage 
 
So how does that apply to software projects?

Most of us have seen projects fail.  
Some of them really badly.

Which fail has hurt the most?  
The one you're still thinking about years after the facts?  
Even after all the rationalization.  

The ones, where I was a involved or witnessed,  
have always been the ones that 
* had too great a scope
* had one, too big, team
* had underestimated legacy systems
* had too much money (!)
* wanted to deliver too much too fast.  
In any combinations

So If I  make an analogy between
* scope , team size and  legacy as the mass
* delivery as the velocity  
The more you have those , the more kinetic energy your project has.
 
*The more potential damage you have if you hit a concrete wall*

P.S.  
Of course all those failures lead to lessons learned...   
And next time we'll do beter, won't we ?
